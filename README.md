# LCRC Experiments

This repository is the source of truth for **LCRC Fills**: small, code-first experiments where I learn by building.

LCRC (Large Code-Run Collider) is a playful CERN-inspired framing, but the goal is practical clarity: **small artifacts with tests, edge cases, and real-world takeaways** around backend, reliability, data, boundaries, and failure modes.

## Structure

- **Fill** = one concept → one compact, runnable artifact (+ notes).
- **Run** = a series of Fills grouped by theme or momentum.
